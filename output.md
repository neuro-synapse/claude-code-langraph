_Date: 2025-09-12_

**Metadata**:
- Attendees: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave
- Duration: 30m

## Executive Summary
The Q4 Scope Lock meeting finalized the development roadmap, prioritizing patterns that can be published within the one-month timeline. This focus ensures timely delivery and alignment with immediate strategic goals.

Key decisions included mandating that all pattern development be tracked in the shared spreadsheet and placing a complex future-state pattern on hold to avoid delays. Critical action items require Jonathan to report on the Pattern 406 scope meeting, the team to document and complete a newly identified pattern, and for a strategic discussion on datamarts to be initiated.

Next steps involve executing these actions promptly, with all prioritized pattern work targeted for completion within the next month.

## Detailed Meeting Notes
### Individual Pattern Development Progress Review (PRIMARY)

Herman Boma led a round-robin status update to assess the progress of each team member's assigned patterns. The primary goal was to ensure development is on track to meet the roughly one-month completion deadline and to identify any blockers or areas needing clarification. Herman emphasized the importance of tracking assignment dates and focusing on patterns that can be published in the near term.

### Main Discussion Points

*   **Jonathan Brain - Pattern 406 (Dataverse and Power BI)**
    *   Progress is currently blocked due to unexpected complexities discovered after meeting with a Subject Matter Expert (SME).
    *   He has escalated the issue to Billy and Alex for guidance on data transformation.
    *   A meeting is scheduled for the upcoming Monday to resolve the issue, which could significantly alter the pattern's scope.
        *   "There's a meeting scheduled for Monday to determine that, and it might have a somewhat material impact on the pattern." - Jonathan Brain
*   **Alecia Laboy - Pattern 173**
    *   Work is ongoing but is currently a low priority.
    *   The main dependency is the lack of an approved technology stack from the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA).
        *   "It's low on my list right now because there's no approved technology from Vida yet." - Alecia Laboy
*   **Kate Goldenberg - Future State Process Pattern**
    *   Her assigned pattern is tied to a larger future-state process and cannot be published independently at this time.
    *   She is actively working on a different, unregistered pattern that is not coupled with future-state dependencies and expects it to be complete in two weeks.
    *   Herman requested she add the new pattern to the tracking list to ensure visibility and progress.
*   **Sindhuja Sane - Logging and Monitoring Pattern**
    *   She has just begun work and needs to formally assign the pattern to herself in the tracking spreadsheet.
    *   Progress is challenging because there is no established logging and monitoring process currently in place.
    *   Herman advised her to focus on documenting the *current state* of logging to make tangible progress while future-state plans are still being defined.
*   **Elizabeth Campbell - Quick Mart / Datamart Light Pattern**
    *   She is working on consolidating three redundant versions of the datamart.
    *   She raised a strategic concern about the long-term viability of datamarts and proposed a future discussion.
        *   "I think datamarts are kind of going by the wayside in the future, so I think we need to have that discussion." - Elizabeth Campbell

### Key Insights or Decisions

*   Team members were reminded of the one-month deadline and the need to focus on completing publishable patterns.
*   Kate Goldenberg will register her new pattern in the tracking spreadsheet.
*   Elizabeth Campbell will facilitate a discussion on the future of datamarts, potentially during the next meeting.

### Questions Raised but Not Answered

*   What is the long-term strategic direction for datamarts within the organization?
*   When will VITA approve the necessary technologies for Pattern 173?

### Related Resources Mentioned

*   Pattern Tracking Spreadsheet (used by Herman to guide the review)

### Guidance on Future vs. Current State Patterns (PRIMARY)

Herman Boma provided clear guidance on prioritizing pattern development to meet the one-month completion deadline. The core directive is to focus on patterns reflecting the current, publishable state rather than expending effort on those tied to unfinalized future-state processes that cannot be completed in the near term. This ensures the team produces tangible, usable outputs within the allotted timeframe.

### Main Discussion Points

*   **Prioritizing Publishable Work Over Future-State Concepts**
    ◦   Herman emphasized that with a one-month deadline, the team's focus must be on patterns that can be completed and published.
    ◦   Patterns that are too dependent on future processes that are not yet finalized should be de-prioritized.
        ▪   "Maybe in the future, maybe we don't work on something that we think that cannot be published, right? We need to choose something that we know can be published, right? That we can have it published if it's something that is too far off. Right, then there's no point, right?" - Herman Boma
*   **Specific Guidance for Kate Goldenberg's Pattern**
    ◦   Kate reported her current pattern is tied to a future-state process and cannot be published because related discussions are still ongoing.
    ◦   Herman suggested she could review the work with the group and leave it in a "holding state," but should shift her primary focus to a different pattern that is not coupled with the future state.
    ◦   He requested she add the new, more immediate pattern to the tracking spreadsheet so its progress can be monitored.
*   **Clarification for Sindhuja Sane's Logging Pattern**
    ◦   Sindhuja noted her "Logging and Monitoring" pattern was challenging because a formal future-state process is not yet in place.
    ◦   Herman advised her to distinguish between the future state (e.g., monitoring after cloud migration) and the current state (e.g., how logging is performed today).
    ◦   He recommended she focus on documenting the current state, as the future state lacks the necessary details for a publishable pattern.

### Key Insights or Decisions

*   **Decision:** The team must prioritize developing patterns that can be finalized and published within the one-month timeline.
*   **Guidance:** Work on patterns dependent on unfinalized future-state processes should be documented and placed in a "holding state." Active development efforts should be redirected to current-state, publishable patterns.

### Questions Raised but Not Answered

*   None for this theme.

### Related Resources Mentioned

*   Pattern Tracking Spreadsheet (used to monitor progress and add new patterns).

### Reinforcing Timelines and Tracking Process (SECONDARY)

Herman Boma opened the progress check-in by reinforcing the project's strict timeline and the critical need for accurate tracking. He emphasized that the team has roughly one month to complete all assigned patterns, making consistent progress and transparent reporting essential for success. The shared spreadsheet was identified as the central tool for monitoring assignments, start dates, and overall status.

### Main Discussion Points

*   **Urgent One-Month Deadline**
    ◦ Herman repeatedly stressed the tight schedule, framing all progress discussions within this one-month window.
    ◦ He stated the goal is to have the patterns wrapped up in the next two weeks or so, highlighting the urgency.
      ▪ "I'm trying to get things within this one month timeline right, making sure that we are able to get these patterns done within the month." - Herman Boma

*   **Mandatory Use of Shared Spreadsheet for Tracking**
    ◦ Herman explained that tracking is not optional and is necessary to monitor progress against the deadline. He needs to capture the dates patterns were assigned to ensure they are on schedule.
    ◦ He conducted a live review of the spreadsheet during the meeting to get status updates from each team member.

*   **Enforcing Tracking Compliance**
    ◦ Herman directly addressed instances where the spreadsheet was not up-to-date, ensuring team members committed to correcting it.
    ◦ **Kate's New Pattern**: When Kate Goldenberg mentioned working on a pattern not listed on the spreadsheet, Herman insisted she add it.
      ▪ "So do you want to add that one so we can track it? ... Because again, we need to track, right?" - Herman Boma
    ◦ **Sindhuja's Assignment**: Herman noted that Sindhuja Sane had not formally assigned the "logging and monitoring" pattern to herself in the spreadsheet and requested she do so.
      ▪ "Please update that right?" - Herman Boma

### Key Insights or Decisions

*   **Decision**: All pattern development work, including newly identified patterns, must be logged and tracked in the shared spreadsheet.
*   **Decision**: Team members are individually responsible for keeping their pattern statuses and assignments current in the spreadsheet. Both Kate and Sindhuja agreed to make the necessary updates.
*   **Insight**: The one-month deadline is a primary driver for all pattern-related work, and future meetings will continue to feature a status check against this timeline.

### Questions Raised but Not Answered

*   There were no unanswered questions related to this theme.

### Open Call for Pattern Reviews (SECONDARY)

Herman Boma initiated the pattern review meeting by opening the floor for submissions, a standard practice designed to facilitate collaborative feedback and unblock progress. The primary goal of this segment was to allow any team member with a completed or partially completed pattern to present their work for group discussion, clarification, or directional guidance. This served as the first agenda item before proceeding to individual status updates.

### Main Discussion Points

*   **Invitation for Submissions and Feedback**
    *   Herman began the meeting with a direct request for any patterns that were ready for a group review.
    *   He explicitly framed this as an opportunity for team members to get feedback, ask questions, or seek more direction if they were experiencing any confusion with their assigned work.
        *   "Does anybody have any pattern to review to be or any questions that they need feedback on? Any confusion about their pattern they're working on and they need more direction." - Herman Boma
    *   The intent was to use the dedicated meeting time to collaboratively address any immediate needs or blockers to ensure progress could continue smoothly.

*   **Group Response and Conclusion**
    *   Following Herman's open invitation, there was no response from the attendees on the call.
    *   No team members volunteered a pattern for review or brought forward any specific issues that required group input at that moment.
    *   After a brief pause, Herman interpreted the silence as confirmation that there were no submissions for the session.
        *   "All right. So I assume that there there are no patterns to review." - Herman Boma

### Key Insights or Decisions

*   The key decision resulting from this open call was procedural: to bypass the review segment of the meeting due to a lack of submissions. Herman pivoted directly to the next agenda item, which was to conduct a round-robin check-in on the status of each person's assigned pattern. This confirmed that no patterns were at a stage requiring group critique during this meeting.

### Questions Raised but Not Answered

*   There were no questions raised that went unanswered. The primary question about the availability of patterns for review was answered implicitly by the group's lack of response.

### Related Resources Mentioned

*   No specific documents, tools, or links were mentioned during this part of the discussion.

### Meeting Logistics and Final Wrap-up (TANGENTIAL)

The meeting concluded after a status check-in on all active patterns with the attending team members. As there were no patterns ready for review and no further agenda items or blocking issues raised, the session was adjourned ahead of schedule. Herman Boma concluded the meeting by assigning himself the task of preparing and distributing the meeting notes to ensure all stakeholders, including those absent, were informed of the discussions.

Main Discussion Points
• Meeting Adjournment
  ◦ The meeting was concluded early because the primary agenda item, reviewing patterns, had no submissions from the team.
  ◦ Herman confirmed there were no other pressing issues or questions from the attendees before deciding to wrap up, offering to give people back time to work on their patterns.
• Action Item: Meeting Notes Distribution
  ◦ Herman Boma took the action item to summarize the meeting's discussions and prepare the notes.
  ◦ He committed to sending out the notes to the entire group to ensure alignment and inform those who were not present.
    ▪ "I will try to wrap up the meet meeting notes and send out so people were not here. We'll see what we talked about." - Herman Boma

## Decisions

- ✓ The team must prioritize developing patterns that can be finalized and published within the one-month timeline. | Rationale: The project has a strict deadline, and focusing on achievable, current-state work ensures tangible outputs are delivered. Future-state patterns are often blocked by unfinalized processes. | Impact: Development efforts will shift from blocked future-state patterns (like Kate's original one) to more immediate, publishable patterns. Sindhuja will focus on the current state of logging. | Dissent: None. Team members accepted the guidance.
- ✓ All pattern development work, including newly identified patterns, must be logged and tracked in the shared spreadsheet. | Rationale: To maintain visibility, ensure accountability, and accurately monitor progress against the tight one-month deadline. | Impact: Kate will add her new pattern to the spreadsheet, and Sindhuja will formally assign her pattern to herself, ensuring the tracking document is a single source of truth. | Dissent: None. Kate and Sindhuja agreed to make the necessary updates.
- ✓ Kate's original future-state process pattern will be documented and placed in a 'holding state'. | Rationale: The pattern is tightly coupled with a larger future-state process that is not yet finalized, making it impossible to publish within the project's timeline. This preserves the work for later use. | Impact: Kate's primary development effort is now officially redirected to a new, publishable pattern. | Dissent: None. Kate agreed to the approach.
- ✓ The pattern review portion of the meeting was skipped. | Rationale: No team members had patterns ready for review or brought forward questions requiring group feedback. | Impact: The meeting agenda shifted directly to status updates, allowing the meeting to conclude early. | Dissent: None.

## Open Questions

- ? What is the long-term strategic direction for datamarts, and are they being phased out? | Context: Elizabeth Campbell is consolidating datamart patterns but noted they 'are kind of going by the wayside in the future.' She proposed a discussion to determine if this work aligns with future strategy. | Suggested owner: Elizabeth Campbell
- ? What is the timeline for VITA to approve the necessary technology stack for Pattern 173? | Context: Alecia Laboy's progress on Pattern 173 is blocked because the required technology has not yet been approved by VITA. This makes the pattern a low priority for her. | Suggested owner: Alecia Laboy
- ? What are the specific data transformation rules required for Pattern 406 (Dataverse and Power BI)? | Context: Jonathan Brain's pattern is blocked due to new, challenging issues discovered with an SME. The pattern's applicability and scope may change significantly based on the outcome. | Suggested owner: Jonathan Brain
