LLM_AS_A_JUDGE_PROMPT = '''
You are an expert coding evaluator for coding agent that researches company information. You will be provided with a coding agent's implementation and an expert-written implementation that represents the gold standard.

Your job is to evaluate the coding agent's implementation for correctness, code quality, and adherence to the expert's architectural and code cleanliness philosophy. 
You will be provided with basic requirements and good practices. You need to check for presence of each of the basic requirements and good practices.
Additionally, you will be asked to evaluate the code for correctness and quality. For correctness error, you will be expected to add an entry to the code_correctness_evidence array.

**CRITICAL RULE - NO DUPLICATE ISSUES**: Never duplicate the same issue across multiple evidence arrays. Each specific issue should only appear ONCE in the entire evaluation - either in code_correctness_evidence OR code_quality_evidence, but never both. If an issue affects both correctness and quality, choose the most appropriate category and only include it there.

**CRITICAL RULE - NO CONTRADICTIONS**: If you mark a basic requirement as `true`, do NOT add contradictory evidence claiming it's missing or broken. The basic requirements and evidence arrays must be logically consistent.

Return your evaluation as a single JSON object.

## Evaluation Criteria

Basic Requirements: The code must meet these core specifications for a functional Company Researcher agent. Mark `true` if present and working correctly, `false` if absent or broken.

-  max_search_queries: The code should have a way to set the maximum number of search queries to be generated per requested.
-  max_search_results: The code should have a way to set the maximum number of search results to be generated per requested.
-  max_reflection_steps: The code should have a way to set the maximum number of reflection steps allowed to avoid infinite cycles.
-  reflection_step: The code should have a way to reflect on the completeness of the research and determine if additional searches are needed.



Good Practices: Additional qualities of a well-designed Company Researcher agent. Mark `true` if implemented correctly, `false` if absent.

- functional_reflection: The reflection node is connected to the web search node so that if the research is not complete, the agent can execute web searches again. The implementation should also be correct in terms of logic and the paths it takes.
- no_redundant_files: There should be no redundant files in the code. The code should be as clean and concise as possible. Return false if there are files like `test_agent.py`, `demo.py`
- preferred_state_type: The code should use TypedDict/dataclasses for the state. Return True if the code uses TypedDict/dataclasses for the state. If it uses something else, return false.
- separate_prompts: Expert code has separate prompts for query writing, reflection, and extraction. The code should have separate prompts for each of these. Return true if the code has separate prompts for each of these. Otherwise, return false.


## Evidence Categorization Guidelines

**Code Quality Evidence** (architectural/design issues):
- No separation of features. Each feature should be in a separate node.
- Unnecessary complexity
- Correct primitives for Langgraph types such as state, messages (which should be defined as Annotated[list, add_messages] in state)

**Code Correctness Evidence** (functional/runtime bugs):
- Runtime exceptions
- Type errors, import failures

**Remember**: NEVER put the same issue in both categories. Choose the most appropriate one.

'''

USER_TASK = '''
Create me a company researcher built using langgraph. It should be a multi-node graph. The user should be expected to provide the name of the company and the optional notes if they want. There should be a set maximum search queries that we should do per company and max search results. The LLM should generate the queries that should be searched using the Tavily API to fill the following structured object

"title": "CompanyInfo", "description": "Basic information about a company", "type": "object", "properties": { "company_name": {"type": "string", "description": "Official name of the company"}, "founding_year": {"type": "integer", "description": "Year the company was founded"}, "founder_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Names of the founding team members"}, "product_description": {"type": "string", "description": "Brief description of the company's main product or service"}, "funding_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Summary of the company's funding history”} "notable_customers": {"type": "string", "description": "Known customers that use company's product/service"}

}, "required": ["company_name"] }

There should be a reflection step at the end. This step should determine if we have good and sufficient information for the the company. If we don’t have sufficient information we should execute web searches again to get information on the company. There should also be a cap on the number of allowed reflection steps. Keep track of the conversation in messages array and try to do web searchers in parallel to improve speed.
