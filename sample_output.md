*   **Success Metrics for MVP**: The team identified the core metrics required to measure the success of the v1 launch.
    *   The essential metrics are Daily Active Users (DAU), conversion rate, and error rate.

#### 2. Decision to Prioritize MVP Launch

Flowing from the scope discussion, this conversation centered on the strategic decision to prioritize speed-to-market with an MVP over a delayed launch with a more comprehensive feature set. The team formally adopted an agile approach to release a core, functional version of the product first and then introduce subsequent features incrementally using feature flags.

**Main Discussion Points**
*   **Strategic Alignment**: The team weighed the benefits of a fast release against a more robust initial offering and formally decided on the MVP path.
    *   > "Proposal: ship the MVP v1 on October 15, then iterate on feature flags." - Bob
*   **Execution and Planning**: Upon agreement, the team defined the immediate next steps for the MVP launch.
    *   Alice confirmed the decision and initiated the process of assigning ownership for follow-up tasks.
    *   Bob was tasked with defining the precise scope of the MVP and creating a detailed rollout strategy, which will be documented in a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and a project plan.
    *   > "Yes, I’ll share a PRD and a project plan in Drive." - Bob

#### 3. Assigning Key Action Items and Owners

Following the strategic decision to target an October 15th launch, the team assigned clear ownership for key workstreams to ensure that dependencies and critical path items were addressed promptly.

**Main Discussion Points**
*   **Analytics API Dependency**: Carol took ownership of investigating the dependency on the Data team's Analytics API, which requires a minor version bump.

### SECONDARY THEMES

With the primary strategy and owners established, the discussion shifted to address specific technical dependencies and risks that could impact the project timeline.

#### 4. Analytics API Version Bump Dependency

A key dependency was identified for the Q4 project: the Analytics API requires a minor version bump to support tracking the necessary metrics for the new features. The readiness of this API directly impacts the project's timeline, particularly the scheduling of the customer pilot.

**Main Discussion Points**
*   **API Upgrade Requirement**: The project is contingent on an update to the Analytics API, which currently operates under a 99.9% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA).
    *   > "Data team dependency: the Analytics API needs a minor version bump" - Carol
*   **Project Impact**: The customer pilot schedule is directly affected by the completion of this API upgrade.
    *   > "Pilot timing depends on API readiness." - Carol
*   **Action Item**: Carol has taken the action item to investigate the timeline and potential risks, such as breaking changes.
    *   > "I’ll confirm the Analytics API schedule and any breaking changes." - Carol

#### 5. Addressing CI Pipeline Instability

In addition to external dependencies, a significant concern was raised regarding the stability of the development infrastructure. Dave highlighted that the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline has become unreliable, posing a threat to the team's ability to meet project timelines.

**Main Discussion Points**
*   **Problem Statement**: The CI pipeline was described as "flaky," evidenced by recent, frequent failures.
    *   > "CI is flaky; we had three pipeline failures last week." - Dave
*   **Proposed Solutions**: Dave suggested a two-pronged technical solution to enhance the pipeline's robustness.
    *   **Upgrade Test Runners**: Upgrading the underlying software and instances responsible for executing automated tests.
    *   **Increase Parallelism**: Enabling multiple test suites to run concurrently to accelerate the feedback loop and alleviate resource contention.
*   **Action Item**: Dave assumed ownership of addressing the pipeline's shortcomings and will create a formal plan.
    *   > "I’ll draft a CI upgrade plan and estimate risk reduction." - Dave

#### 6. Open Questions on Pilot and Metrics

Towards the end of the meeting, the conversation shifted to address unresolved questions regarding the go-to-market strategy and success measurement.

**Main Discussion Points**
*   **Customer Pilot Timing**: Alice raised the question of the timing for the customer pilot program.
    *   > "Any open questions? Timing for customer pilot?" - Alice
    *   Carol clarified that the timing is directly dependent on the readiness of the Analytics API, making it a key dependency to track.
    *   > "Pilot timing depends on API readiness." - Carol
*   **"Must-Have" v1 Metrics**: Alice also asked about the essential metrics required for the v1 launch.
    *   > "Also, which metrics are must-have for v1?" - Alice
    *   Carol proposed an initial set of three core metrics to cover user engagement, feature effectiveness, and application stability.
    *   > "Metrics: DAU, conversion rate, and error rate." - Carol

### TANGENTIAL THEMES

Finally, the discussion briefly revisited the initial strategic choice to ensure full alignment and document the context for the MVP decision.

#### 7. Evaluating Scope Options

The discussion covered the strategic choice for the upcoming Q4 launch, with the goal of finalizing scope and timelines. The team decided between a rapid release of a core product or a more extended timeline to deliver a richer set of features.

**Main Discussion Points**
*   **Initial Proposal**: Bob framed the decision by presenting two potential scope options for the Q4 launch: an MVP by October 15, or a broader feature set that would delay the launch into November.
*   **Decision and Path Forward**: The team aligned on launching the MVP first and building upon it iteratively.
    *   > "Proposal: ship the MVP v1 on October 15, then iterate on feature flags." - Bob
    *   Bob took ownership of creating the formal MVP plan, which will include a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and a project plan, to be shared in Google Drive.
