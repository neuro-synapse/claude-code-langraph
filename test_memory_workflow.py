Test script for the memory-enhanced meeting transcript processing workflow.

This script demonstrates continuous action item tracking across multiple meetings,
showing how the agent can:
1. Track action items across meetings
2. Escalate items that are mentioned repeatedly
3. Provide memory insights about recurring issues
4. Generate context-aware summaries

Usage:

[00:00] Alice: Welcome to our weekly engineering standup. Let's start with updates.

[00:05] Bob: I'm working on the authentication system. We've identified a critical bug in the login flow that's causing users to be logged out unexpectedly.

[00:10] Alice: That's a high priority issue. Bob, can you commit to fixing this authentication bug by Friday?

[00:15] Bob: Yes, I'll have it fixed by Friday. It's a session management issue in the middleware.

[00:20] Carol: I'm blocked on the frontend work until Bob fixes the auth issue. The login component keeps failing.

[00:25] Alice: Understood. Carol, once Bob fixes the auth bug, how long will your frontend work take?

[00:30] Carol: Probably 2-3 days after the auth fix is deployed.

[00:35] Dave: I'm working on the CI pipeline. We need to upgrade the test runners to reduce build times.

[00:40] Alice: Dave, can you create a plan for the CI upgrades by next week?

[00:45] Dave: Yes, I'll draft a CI upgrade plan by Tuesday.

[00:50] Alice: Great. Let's close here and follow up on the action items.

[00:00] Alice: Welcome to this week's standup. Let's check on our action items.

[00:05] Bob: I'm still working on that auth issue we discussed last week. It's more complex than expected - the session tokens are being invalidated prematurely.

[00:10] Alice: How much longer do you think it will take?

[00:15] Bob: I need another week. The root cause is in our token refresh logic.

[00:20] Carol: I'm still blocked on my frontend work. I can't test the login component until the auth issue is resolved.

[00:25] Alice: This is becoming a blocker for multiple people. Bob, can you prioritize this and get it done by Wednesday?

[00:30] Bob: I'll do my best, but Wednesday might be tight. Let me commit to Friday at the latest.

[00:35] Dave: I've drafted the CI upgrade plan. We need to upgrade Docker images and increase parallelism.

[00:40] Alice: Great work Dave. When can we start implementing?

[00:45] Dave: I'd like to start next week if the team agrees.

[00:15] Bob: You know, the authentication bug we've been discussing. The one where users keep getting logged out.

[00:20] Carol: Oh right, that's been blocking my frontend work for weeks now. Any ETA on when it'll be fixed?

[00:25] Bob: I'm targeting end of this week, but I'm not 100% confident given how complex this has been.

[00:30] Alice: This has been dragging on for a while. Is there anything we can do to help unblock this?

[00:35] Dave: I could pair with Bob on this if it would help. I've been working on similar session issues in the CI system.

[00:40] Bob: That would actually be helpful. Dave, can we pair tomorrow morning?

[00:45] Dave: Absolutely. I'll block my calendar.
